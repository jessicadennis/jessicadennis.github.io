      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>
        Jessica Dennis has been pushing pixels since jQuery was cool and flexbox
        was but a twinkle in the W3C's collective eye. Starting out with nothing
        but an English B.A. and a dream, she Jessica joined the IT help desk at
        UC Riverside, eventually parlaying her WordPress hobbyist experience
        into a web development position. From there, Jessica made her way across
        the country and around the web, from public higher education to large
        corporations to small startups to a national lab, picking up a master's
        in Computer Information Systems with a database management concentration
        along the way. Jessica finally found her home in front-end focused
        full-stack application development (and the Washington, DC metro area).
      </p>
      <p>
        Jessica has considerable expertise in modern front-end frameworks such
        React and Angular, and has dabbled in Svelte and Vue, among others. She
        came to appreciate, perhaps even enjoy, TypeScript, after working in
        vanilla JavaScript for many years. Although Jessica is quite
        accomplished with Tailwind, long before she started using it, she had
        mastered CSS and SCSS (and memorized a great deal of Bootstrap, albeit
        not intentionally). More recently, Jessica has worked on .Net Entity
        Framework REST and GraphQL APIs, and throughout has maintained
        substantial knowledge of SQL, primarily MS SQL and PostgreSQL.
      </p>
      <p>
        In her spare time, Jessica has recorded and produced podcasts on a
        variety of topics, and has served as a volunteer webmaster for the
        Redlands Humane Society since 2009.
