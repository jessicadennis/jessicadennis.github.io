      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>
        Jessica Dennis (she/her) has been pushing pixels since jQuery was cool
        and flexbox was but a twinkle in the
        <abbr class="cursor-help" title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>'s
        collective eye. Starting out with nothing but a B.A. in English and a
        dream, Jessica joined the IT help desk at UC Riverside, eventually
        parlaying her WordPress hobbyist experience into a webmaster position.
        From there, she made her way across the country and around the web, from
        public higher education to large corporations to small startups to a
        national lab, picking up a master's in Computer Information Systems
        (with a database management concentration) along the way. Jessica
        finally found her home in front-end focused full-stack application
        development (and the Washington, D.C. metro area).
      </p>
      <p class="print:hidden">
        Jessica has considerable expertise in modern front-end frameworks such
        React and Angular, and has dabbled in Svelte and Vue, among others. She
        came to appreciate, perhaps even enjoy, TypeScript, after working in
        vanilla JavaScript for many years. Although Jessica is quite
        accomplished with Tailwind, she has long since mastered CSS and SCSS
        (and memorized a great deal of Bootstrap, albeit not intentionally).
        More recently, Jessica has worked on C# REST and GraphQL API
        applications, and has maintained substantial knowledge of SQL, primarily
        MS SQL and PostgreSQL throughout her career.
      </p>
      <p class="print:hidden">
        In her spare time, Jessica has recorded and produced podcasts on a
        variety of topics, and has served as a volunteer webmaster for the
        Redlands Humane Society since 2009.
